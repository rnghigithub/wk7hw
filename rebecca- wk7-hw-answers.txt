1. 
 - introduced by Apple
 - used for the Mac OS X Webkit component in 2004.

2.  
- canvas tag/element an HTML5 element that can be used to draw graphics usiNG JavaScript. the canvas element only cotians the graphics, 
JavaScript must be used to draw graphics. It can be used to draw graphs, combine photos or create animations. 
2d stands for 2 dimensional



3. 
 - It can be as simple as <canvas></canvas>

4. 
- width and height attributes 

5. 
- the default canvas size is 300w x 150h 

6.
- nothing will render to the page

7. 
- the default canvas size of 300w x 150h would be rendered to the page. 


8. 
 - A context would need to be created in order to gain access to the actual drawing interface. A context is an object whose methods
 provide the drawing interface. 

9. 
- 2d for 2 dimensional graphics
- webgl for 3 dimensional graphics 


10. 
- We can access our drawing connected by using the HTML5 canvas built in .getContext() method. So in the index.html we have <canvas></canvas> 
as the HTML5 element 


11.
= primitive shapes: rectangles
- paths.paths


12. 
- Other shapes are created by a combination of one or more paths. Built in canvas paths help us create these complex shapes.


13. 
- fillRect() - fillRect(x, y, width, height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate of the upper left corner of rectangle
  y- the y-axis of the upper left corner of rectangle
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are down

- strokeRect() - ctx.strokeRect(x, y,width,height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate rectangle start point. 
  y- the y-axis  coordinate rectangle start point. 
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are up

- clearRect() - ctx.clearRect(x, y,width,height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate rectangle start point. 
  y- the y-axis  coordinate rectangle start point. 
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are up


14.
- a list of points connected by segments of lines that can be various shapes. They can be curved with different widths and colors. 

15.
- Draw a path
- Use drawing commands to draw into the path
- Once path is created, via stroke() or fill () to render the path.
